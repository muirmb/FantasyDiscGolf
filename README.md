# FantasyDiscGolf
## Overview
FantasyDiscGolf is the new site where friends can compete against each other during the professional disc golf season!  Just like other fantasy sports (e.g. football and basketball) you will draft a team at the beginning of the season and go head-to-head against another team in your league each week.  

## Get Started
### Create an Account
You must create an account before joining a league or making a team.  To create an account, follow these steps:
1. Click 'Login'
2. Click 'New user? Register here'
3. Enter a valid email that has not been already used to make an account
4. Enter a valid username that has not been taken
5. Enter a valid password and re-enter the password
6. Click 'Register'
Now that you have made an account, you can join leagues, create teams, and compete against other teams

### Create a league
To actively participate in FantasyDiscGolf, you must be part of at least one league.  This is where you can manage a team and go head-to-head with others.  To create a league, follow these steps:
1. Login to your account
2. Click 'League'
3. In the CREATE LEAGUE section of the page, enter a valid league name that has not been taken
4. Enter a valid password
5. Select a number of teams (options range from 4 to 10)
6. Select a draft date
7. Select a draft time
8. Click 'Create League'

Once the league is created, a team will automatically be made for you in this league, and you will be the first team manager in the league.  Other invitees to the league will be able to see this league under the JOIN LEAGUE section.

## Testimony
Recently ago, my friends and I decided to have some competitive fun while watching the 2023 Disc Golf Pro Tour (DGPT).  We used simple spreadsheets to create our own "fantasy disc golf". Each of us drafted a team and faced an opponent each tournament.  This little competition was very enjoyable, but managing the spreadsheets each week became repetitive and tiresome.  I realized that this could be avoided with an easy-to-use website that keeps track of players, teams, and matchups in a league.
